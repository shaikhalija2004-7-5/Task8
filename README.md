- The East region contributes the highest sales (30.17%), followed by Central (27.38%) and West (19.93%).
- The South region lags behind (3.76%), indicating potential growth opportunities or underperformance.

## Insight 2: Product Sales & Quantity Mismatch
- Products like Canon ImageClass 2200 and HP LaserJet 330 Copier generate high sales values despite relatively low quantities sold.
- Conversely, some items like Binders and Paper have high quantities sold but lower sales revenue → showing they are low-value, high-volume items.

- From the sales breakdown, it is clear that Consumer segment dominates the order volume, suggesting retail buyers are the largest revenue drivers compared to corporate or home office clients.

## Insight 5: Payment Mode Preferences
